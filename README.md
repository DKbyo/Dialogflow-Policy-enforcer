# Dialogflow-Policy-enforcer
#### Used to enforce Dialogflow CX configuration policies:

### Policy 1: Dialogflow CX Agent logging policy is to enable agent logs.

### Policy 2. Dialogflow's webhooks cannot include static credentials (username/password)


##Overall enforcer flow:

#### Dialogflow audit logs -> Cloud router sink -> Pub/Sub -> Cloud Functions -> Apply policies

### Configuration steps:

1. Enable all Audit logs for Dialoglow API.


2. Create org-level Cloud log router/log-sink sending to pub/sub topic.

   * Exclude the logs generated by Cloud Functions' service account.
   * Logs included on filter:

       
       protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalEmail!="<project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com>" AND
       protoPayload.serviceName="dialogflow.googleapis.com" AND 
       (Webhooks.CreateWebhook OR
       Webhooks.UpdateWebhook OR 
       Agents.CreateAgent OR 
       Agents.UpdateAgent)

       
  * Make sure to grant Publisher permissions to the logging service account.


4. Create Cloud Function as a subscription of the Pub/sub topic. 


5. Implement Cloud function with main.py code
