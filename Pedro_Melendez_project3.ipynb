        "\n",
        "The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. Logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small total size. The default L2 regularization computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (as in Part 3 above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. Whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, **L1 regularization drives many of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features**. For this reason, we can use it as a way to do \"feature selection\".\n",
        "\n",
        "1. For several L1 regularization strengths ...\n",
        "  1. Produce a Logistic Regression model using the **L1** regularization strength.  Reduce the vocabulary to only those features that have at least one non-zero weight among the four categories.\n",
        "  1. Produce a new Logistic Regression model using the reduced vocabulary . For this new model, use an **L2** regularization strength of 0.5.  \n",
        "  1. Evaluate and show the L1 regularization strength, vocabulary size, and f1 score associated with the new model.\n",
        "1. Show a plot of f1 score vs. log vocabulary size.  Each point corresponds to a specific L1 regularization strength used to reduce the vocabulary.\n",
        "1. How does performance of the models based on reduced vocabularies compare to that of a model based on the full vocabulary?\n",

        "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., penalty=\"l2\")` to produce a logistic regression model using L2 regularization.\n",
        "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., tol=0.015)` to produce a logistic regression model using relaxed gradient descent convergence criteria.  The gradient descent code that trains the logistic regression model sometimes has trouble converging with extreme settings of the C parameter. Relax the convergence criteria by setting tol=.015 (the default is .0001).\n",
